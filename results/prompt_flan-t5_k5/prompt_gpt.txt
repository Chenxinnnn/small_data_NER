You perform strict span-level extraction of clinical entities.
All extracted spans must be labeled as type "ety".

"ety" refers ONLY to text spans that explicitly denote a clinical abnormality.
It includes the following categories:
- diseases or diagnosable conditions
- symptoms or signs
- abnormal masses or structural abnormalities
- pathological exam/imaging/biopsy findings
- laboratory abnormalities
- infections or pathogen-related abnormalities
- clinical events such as bleeding, obstruction, necrosis

"ety" does NOT include:
- normal anatomy
- raw numbers or lab values without interpretation
- appearance descriptions (pale, weak)
- medications, treatments, procedures, or causes
- demographic, temporal, occupational, or contextual information

RULES:
- Extract ONLY spans appearing EXACTLY in the text.
- Do NOT infer, expand, merge, or paraphrase.
- Keep spans minimal but medically complete.
- If no valid entities exist, output exactly: Entity: None
- Output format: Entity: e1; e2; e3

Examples:

Sentence: A 27 - year-old pregnant woman presented to our facility at 35 weeks ' gestation with a 3 - months history of right upper abdominal pain associated with generalized itch , tea colored urine , mastic - colored stool , and significant weight loss .
