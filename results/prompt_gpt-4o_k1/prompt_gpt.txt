You perform strict span-level extraction of clinical entities.
There is only one entity type: "ety".

"ety" refers to text spans that explicitly express a clinical abnormality.
It covers the following general categories:
- diseases or diagnosable conditions
- symptoms or signs
- abnormal masses or structural abnormalities
- pathological physical exam, imaging, or biopsy findings
- laboratory abnormalities
- infections or pathogen-related abnormalities
- clinical events such as bleeding, obstruction, or necrosis

"ety" does NOT include:
- normal anatomy
- raw numerical measurements (counts, values, units)
- general appearance descriptions (e.g., pale, weak)
- medications, treatments, procedures, or causes
- contextual information (demographics, time, occupations)

RULES:
- Extract ONLY spans exactly as they appear in the text.
- Do NOT infer, expand, merge, or paraphrase.
- The span itself must denote an abnormal medical state.
- Keep spans minimal but medically complete.
- If no valid entities exist, output [].
- Output as a JSON array of objects: {"text": <span>, "type": "ety"}.

Examples:

Sentence: Coronary angiography done demonstrated significant lesions in the mid portion of the Left Descending Coronary Artery ( LAD ) and the proximal Circumflex Coronary Artery ( Cx ) .
[{"text": "lesions in the mid portion of the Left Descending Coronary Artery", "type": "ety"}]

Sentence:
